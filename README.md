# pandas-challenge

Analyze the city's school district standardized test results helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

## Code
This analysis was written in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.

- Repo:  `pandas-challenge`
- Folder: `PyCitySchools`
- Notebook:  `PyCitySchools.ipynb`
- Resources: `schools_complete.csv`, `students_complete.csv`

## District Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

Include the following:

1. Total number of unique schools
2. Total students
3. Total budget
4. Average math score
5. Average reading score
6. % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
7. % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
8. % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
   
## School Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.

Include the following:

1. School name
2. School type
3. Total students
4. Total school budget
5. Per student budget
6. Average math score
7. Average reading score
8. % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
9. % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
10. % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by `% Overall Passing` in descending order and display the top 5 rows.

Save the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".

## Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by `% Overall Passing` in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.

## Math Scores by Grade
Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

## Reading Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

## Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).

Include the following metrics in the table:

1. Average math score
2. Average reading score
3. % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
4. % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
5. % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## Scores by School Size
Break down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

## Scores by School Type
Show school performance based on the "School Type".
